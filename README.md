# Java_Multimedia_My_Space:

Dear My Friends,

This is the subject that I studied in my master 2 in Innovation Network and Image at University Sorbonne Paris Nord - 2021 - 2022.

1) Tool preparation:
  - Using IDE Eclipse for Java - super-strong support: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  - Or using IntelliJ IDEA Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/promo/?msclkid=0d540ae72d86198799ea6b079a8565e9&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=EMEA_en_FR_IDEA_Branded&utm_term=intellij%20IDEA&utm_content=intellij%20idea

2) Course:
  - Using the book that I attached in this workspace but it is in Vietnamese. Bla Bla Bla.
  - If reading book makes you feel ill (hahahaha), you can refer the online courses by using Google.
      + Ex: Codeacademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java
      + Ex: W3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/java/
  - Or you can learn by reading any same example code or minor project code -> search the meaning of the function that you are concern about.

3) You can also refer to my TP - practical work in class, or my major project, which requires creating "ANALOG AND DIGITAL CLOCK".

THIS QUOTE PASSIONATED ME A LOT: "BIRD BY BIRD".

Good Luck/Bon Courage/Chúc may mắn.
